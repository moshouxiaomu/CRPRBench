Formatting rules: - Multiple reactants in a set separated by ""."". - Use SMILES. You may think step by step, and the final answer should be formatted as follows: Reactant Set 1: <SMILES>[valid_SMILES_1]</SMILES>; Reactant Set 2: <SMILES>[valid_SMILES_2]</SMILES>.","Chemical Reasoning Task: Identify two distinct reactant pathways containing compound A that both synthesize target molecule B.
